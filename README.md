## Project Description

The BSP project focuses on analyzing EEG data, with specific attention to the alpha, beta, and theta bands. The project includes several MATLAB scripts to process and visualize the data, including plotting PSDs, coherence, and topographic maps.

## Key Features

- **EEG Data Processing:** Scripts for processing and analyzing EEG data.
- **Power Spectral Density (PSD):** Calculation and visualization of PSD for different EEG bands.
- **Coherence Analysis:** Scripts for plotting coherence between different brain regions.
- **Topographic Maps:** Visualization of EEG activity across different scalp regions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- MATLAB (version R2020b or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndreaScarpellini1/BSP-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd BSP-Project
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Scripts

To process the EEG data:

1. Open the MATLAB scripts located in the repository.
2. Run the script corresponding to the analysis you want to perform:

   ```matlab
   run('Project_definitivo.m')
   ```

### Viewing the Results

The scripts will generate various plots, including PSDs and coherence maps, which can be viewed directly in MATLAB.

## Results

The results section includes:

- **PSD Results:** Visualization of the power spectral density for different EEG bands.
- **Coherence Analysis:** Coherence between different regions of the brain.
- **Topographic Maps:** Scalp distributions of EEG activity.
